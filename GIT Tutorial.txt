Steps:

1. Create a github account
2. Sign in to github
3. Create a new repository named "akirachix"
- DO NOT Select the option of "Initialize this repository with Readme.md"
4. Open GIT GUI

5. Create New Repository
- Direct repository location to your folder location
6. Open GIT Bash
- Make sure the location on the cmd reads the location of your folder / local repository

THINGS THAT WILL ONLY BE DONE ONCE:
-- git config --global user.email "aloopascal@gmail.com"
--git config --global user.name "aloopascal"

How to check username and email:
- Search on computer "gitconfig"
- Locate file and open in folder
- Right Click and Open with notepad
- You will see email = "your email" and name = "your username"

* Make sure this information is correct!!!
*
7. git init
- This is the same action as we had initialised with GIT GUI. If not using GIT GUI, this would be the first action on the cmd
8. git status
- This shows you the status of your folder.. Whether there are any commits made
9. git add <filename> to add specific file or git add . to add all files
10. git commit -m "Description"
Adding your files to cart.

WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY BE DONE ONCE.
11. git remote add origin https://github.com/aloopascal/akirachix.git
12. Make sure to confirm this by clicking git remote -v
13. If there is an error:
use: git remote set-url --add origin <NAME OF REPOSITORY>
Once you set the new one, delete the old one using
git remote set-url --delete origin <NAME OF REPOSITORY>

14. With git remote -v it should read the right repository.
15. git push origin master.
- It should bring you a place to put in your username and password.
16. put in password and username
17. Voila!


Possible Errors:
1.
To https://github.com/aloopascal/akirachix.git
! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/aloopascal/akirachix.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.


This is caused by uploading to a repository that does not match your folder. In this case it is initialised with README.md and our folder does not have a README.
Solution: Sync the folders using
git pull origin master
Check folder to confirm
